## RouteTestTask



This project is one of test task for iOS junior developer.

The application is designed to build a route through geographical points that the user has chosen. When adding three or more points, buttons appear: "route" and "reset".

When you click on the "route" button, the shortest route is displayed on the map.

If you click the reset button, the route is canceled, the selected points on the map are deleted.

In this project I used MapKit, the interface was developed in code.
